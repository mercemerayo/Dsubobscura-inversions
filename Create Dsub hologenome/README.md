# **Hologenome Generation: `Hologenome_RefGenome_Dsubobscura.sh`**

## **Description**
This script generates a hologenome by concatenating genomes from different species. It also processes the reference genome of *Drosophila subobscura* to ensure compatibility with downstream analyses.

## **Requirements and Usage**
The script has been tested and successfully generates output files in both **Windows** and **Linux** environments.

### **Windows**
- Simply **double-click** the script file to start execution.
- This will generate the **hologenome** and process the **reference genome** of *Drosophila subobscura*.

### **Linux**
- Open a terminal and execute the script as follows:
```bash
./Hologenome_RefGenome_Dsubobscura.sh
```
